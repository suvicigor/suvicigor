## ◾️ About me

My name is Igor Suvić. I am currently a college student in Belgrade and I study maths and programming. Writing new codes, achieving goals and working on myself makes me feel awesome. My hobbies are art and web design, in the free time I fully commit myself to trying to making my pages look better and I enjoy doing it. After I finish college I would like to work on developing software or something simillar.
